# GoogleTrends
Time series data is everywhere; from temperature records,
to unemployment rates, to the S&P 500 Index. Another rich source of time series data is Google Trends,
where you can freely download the search interest of terms and topics from as far back as 2004.
This project dives into manipulating and visualizing Google Trends data to find unique insights.

In this projectâ€™s guided variant, you will explore the search data underneath the Kardashian family's fame and make custom plots
to find how the most famous Kardashian/Jenner sister has changed over time. In the unguided variant,
you will analyze the worldwide search interest of five major internet browsers to calculate metrics such as rolling average and percentage change.
